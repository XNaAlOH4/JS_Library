# JS_Library

This is where I'll be storing my javascript libraries and optimisations

1. PhysicsEngine
- Sorting Algorithms
- Vectors (3D Vector, Line, Plane)
- Matrix (Well this is more math so I'll probably move it)
- Physics Engine which stores position, velocity and acceleration

2. MathEngine
- Convex polygon math(Overlaps and other stuff)
- minimax?
- graph-theory alogrithms
- Basic Neural Network for AI??(maybe in a different file)
- Concave polygon (Can I pull it off? well only 1 way to find out)
- Fourier stuff
- I want to use this to represent eqns(like 3blue 1 brown)

3. Trees
- Binary Tree
- n-Tree (such as the quad tree)
- Linked Recursive Trees

4. Binary Representation Optimisation???

5. Minimum Calculator
- A Library which calculates minimum values for optimal speed for most of the things I am making
